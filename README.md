# Apple
A stupid easy framework designed for multiplatform use. This includes Forge, Fabric, and Quilt. Made with modernity in mind, this will provide
a sleek experience for any modders to use in their configurations or menus.

## Why?
Well, there's a few reasons behind this:

* Isolysm's mods are planned having more fancy UIs.
* This is mainly a project for me to expand upon our knowledge of LWJGL and OpenGL

## Warnings
This mod is very experimental! You will experience crashes. 

This mod DOESN'T require Essential. Essential is add or not add for us, and isn't required for the 
menu to run.

This mod also uses OpenGL. You will crash if you are using some ancient system, so keep that in mind.
