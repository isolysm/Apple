# ModernMenu
The most modern menu out for no reason.

Since I didn't really enjoy the configurations of [TerraformersMC's Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu), I decided to create
a more modern menu that this organization's mod uses. Due to this, there will be a few issues with the way the implementation works.

This is **NOT** for outside use. We won't give support for this mod. 

## Warnings
This mod is very experimental! You will experience crashes.
