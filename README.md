# Apple
The most modern menu out for no reason. This is bundled with all of our mods, and is meant to serve the users of Quilt in
most situations. 

Note: This does work with ModMenu, we just use a different button in order to get to our configs.

## Why?
Well, there's a few reasons behind this:

* Isolysm's mods are planned having more fancy UIs.
* This is mainly a project for me to expand upon our knowledge of LWJGL and OpenGL

This is **NOT** for outside use. We won't give support for this mod. 

## Warnings
This mod is very experimental! You will experience crashes. 

This mod DOESN'T require Essential. Essential is add or not add for us, and isn't required for the 
menu to run.

This mod also uses OpenGL. You will crash if you are using some ancient system, so keep that in mind.
