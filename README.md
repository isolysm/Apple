# ModernMenu
The most modern menu out for no reason. This is bundled with all of our mods, and is meant to serve the users of Quilt in
most situations. 

Note: This does work with ModMenu, we just use a different button in order to get to our configs.

## Why?
Well, there's a few reasons behind this:

* Isolysm's mods are planned having more fancy UIs.
* This is mainly a project for me to expand upon our knowledge of LWJGL and OpenGL

This is **NOT** for outside use. We won't give support for this mod. 

## Warnings
This mod is very experimental! You will experience crashes. 

This mod also uses OpenGL. You will crash if you are using some ancient system, so keep that in mind.
