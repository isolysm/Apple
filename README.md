# ModernMenu
The most modern menu out for no reason.

Note: This does work with ModMenu, we just use a different button in order to get to our configs.

## Why?
Well, there's a few reasons behind this:

* Isolysm's mods are planned having more fancy UIs.
* This is mainly a project for me to expand upon our knowledge of LWJGL and OpenGL

## Warnings
This mod is very experimental! You will experience crashes.
